Description:   The purpose of this lab is to create base dice roll mechanics and loot generation for the Players (User) and Dungeon Master (Administrator)
of the popular fantasy role playing game known as Pathfinder.  It is to be used in partnership with the rest of the normal version of the game as it does not
retain every required action that players can possibly use in the game itself.  Using all the forumulas related to Player skills, there are various types of die
rolling.  Players receive different bonuses to their dice rolls from our already provided, generated character's skill statistics.  Players will be able to manage the
character's health, initiative role (who goes first in combat), attack role (if they would hit or miss/ how much damage they would do), save checks (the ability to
dodge something or take less damage), etc... As said earlier it is to be used to only perform these actions and the rest of the game still must be managed by the
Dungeon Master and Players regularly.  Players of this game understand the meaning of roles and Dungeon Masters are the ones who outside of this program determine
how the rolls effect the Players.
